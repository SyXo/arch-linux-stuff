1. Follow the guide roughly found at:

  https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/installation_guide

2. When partitioning, we need at minimum one EFI boot partition and win linux partition for the filesystem.
    - use gdisk
    - boot partition over 512M (I did 1024M). Type is EFI (code is ef00).
    
3. Format EFI partition as fat32 : mkfs.vfat -F32 /dev/sda<WHATEVER>

4. Format Linux partition as ext4 (or whatever).

5. Linux Swap (if used) as type Linux Swap.

6. Mount linux file system to /mnt (mount /dev/sda3<whatever> /mnt)

6. Mount EFI boot to /mnt/boot (mount -t vfat /dev/sda1<whatever> /mnt/boot)

7. When installing base system use: pacstrap base base-devel efibootmgr vim

8. We should be able to use efibootmgr to boot the system at startup:

  efibootmgr -d /dev/sdX -p Y -c -g -L "Arch Linux" -l /vmlinuz-linux -u "root=/dev/sdBZ rw initrd=/initramfs-linux.img"
  Where /dev/sdX and Y are the disk and partition where the ESP is located. Change the root= parameter to reflect your Linux root. Y is the number of the partition (e.g. 1 or 2)
 
  BUT
  
  This won't work in VirtualBox over hard-resets because it will clear the NVRAM (or something). Instead, go the boot directory and add
  the file "startup.nsh" which will be run by the UEFI Shell first and put this line in the file (which is the line used to boot linux from
  the shell):
  
  vmlinuz-linux rw root=/dev/sda3<whatever> initrd=/initramfs-linux.img

  (Note on the Arch Linux page, the forward slash for initrd is backwards, which seems not to work in VB).
