Add a non-root user
	- Note the root user won't automatically get some config files
	  in their home (/root) directory, such as .bash_profile, but
	  they can be added.

Install vim

Install nvidia drivers (search for "Nvidia" on Arch wiki page)
	- If getting weird conflict errors, try a different supplier
	  if prompted by pacman (e.g. mesa or whatever).

Install xorg-server
Install xorg-xinit
	- follow the directions for configuration on the Arch Linux
	  Beginner's site carefully. Note that if it's loading and
	  quitting straight away, one possible explanation is that
	  xterm is being loaded at the bottom of .xinitrc, and xterm
	  is not installed. Also maybe install xorg-xclock & xpdf.
   - For some reason for me, .xinitrc (when copied from the default
	  file as described in the above website) was loading three
	  terminal windows.
	  
Install openbox
     - just install the openbox package.
           - Edit .xinitrc and add exec openbox-session (note: not just "openbox", although it will work, it won't be a proper session).
	   - create and edit ~/.config/openbox/autostart file - all commands should end with an &

Set Background Image
	- Install the arch packaged 'feh' which is a command line image
	  viewer.
   - feh --bg-scale <image-path>
		- This command will set a background for the X window system
		  and is useful if no desktop manager, window manager, etc.
		  is installed (or they just don't support BG images).

Configure xterm
	- Look up "X Resources" on Arch Linux site.
