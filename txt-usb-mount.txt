First, list the partitions using "list block devices" command:

lsblk -pf

Note the device node (i.e. path) to the disk block on the device.

Second, mount the disk block as super-user:

mount <device node> <mount dir>

To mount with permissions:

e.g. mount -o guid=users,fmask=113,dmask=002, <device node> <mount dir>

-o ... with he following comma seperated options (no spaces)
guid=<group id> ... group id -necessary for rw access
fmask=xxx,dmask=xxx ... permissions for files and ?disk or directories - I think disk?
								for some silly reason this is a mask of normal permissions. For 777, use 000.

VIRTUALBOX NOTE: For some reason, the fmask and dmask values in the example above are what was recommended for mounting shared folders.
